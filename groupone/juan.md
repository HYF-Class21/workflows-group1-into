Nice to meet you! I'm very excited to be part of this group and to share/discuss
all of my knowledge. I'm also hoping that **everyone participates** so we can
walk through this journey together :sun: .

Keep in mind that i don't have any background in IT so hopefully we can set up a
pace that everyone can get used to.
